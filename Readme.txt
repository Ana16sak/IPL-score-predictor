This model predicts a score of a given IPL team at the end of 6 overs

the training data was used from https://cricsheet.org/

I've used an ensemble model with a Random Forest and a Gradient boost Reggresor and trained on these features
1. venue
2. innings
3. Batting team
4. bowling team
5. wickets taken in the first 6 overs

will deploy the model soon..
